# MR2CSV

Toool for exporting MangaRock favorite to a csv file. Only for android devices.

## Usage

Pre-requesites:
 - Java
 - I think nothing more. But I didn't tested this on another computer so...
 
1 - Enable USB Debugging on your phone. Plug your phone onto usb.

2 - Extract my zip lol, in there will be 4 files. (adb.exe, tar.exe, MR2CSV.exe and abe.jar)

3 - Just open MR2CSV.exe and click "Extract DB".

4 - Your phone probably gonna ask permission for the debugging thing, just ok that.

5 - After that is gonna appear a screen on your phone asking for backuping an apk, just click to do the backup without password. (If you run into problems in that part, just remove your lock screen)

6 - Now is just wait, the programs will be running and the result is a mangarock.db in your folder, then click "Open DB" on mr2csv.

7 - You can get your csv or make whatever you wanna to the database.
